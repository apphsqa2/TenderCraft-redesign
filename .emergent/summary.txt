The AI engineer, Emergent, successfully developed the TenderCraft frontend application, a functional prototype for a tender/procurement platform. The core task was to translate provided screenshots into a responsive, maintainable, and aesthetically pleasing UI using React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui. Emergent adopted a rigorous design system-first approach, prioritizing semantic HSL color tokens, CVA variants, and adherence to strict design guidelines for gradients, typography, and spacing.

Key steps included conducting design research, setting up a comprehensive design system in  and , and then creating all necessary components and pages using a . After initial development, a CSS error () was identified via screenshot analysis and promptly fixed. The application underwent thorough automated testing using , passing all checks, including mobile responsiveness.

The project is currently complete from a development standpoint, featuring mock data for all interactions. The AI engineer then provided detailed instructions for local setup, archived the project, and initiated the process to push the code to a user-provided GitHub repository, awaiting the user's preferred authentication method. The trajectory demonstrates a systematic, quality-focused development process with strong emphasis on design principles and testing.

<product_requirements>
The user explicitly requested the development of a frontend application based on three provided screenshots: two showing a Discover Tenders section (with filters open and closed) and one depicting a Details page of a tender. The application needed to be coded in HTML and CSS, but leveraging modern frontend technologies like React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui primitives, as per the environment setup.

Critical requirements included:
1.  **Usability and Modifiability:** The code must be clean, maintainable, and easily editable to facilitate future layout changes.
2.  **Responsiveness:** The design must be mobile-first and adapt gracefully across different screen sizes.
3.  **Adherence to Layout and Scheme:** The implemented UI should precisely match the provided screenshots.
4.  **Design Excellence:** A design system-first approach was mandated, emphasizing semantic HSL color tokens, CVA variants, thoughtful spacing, typography, micro-animations, and content-aware layouts to achieve a visually appealing and human-made feel. Prohibited gradient and text color rules were strictly enforced.
5.  **Mock Functionality:** As a prototype, mock data and frontend-only interactions were acceptable, ensuring a functional and complete teaser experience without backend integration.

The AI engineer successfully implemented a TenderCraft application, fulfilling all these requirements, including comprehensive visual matching and responsive behavior verified through screenshots and automated tests.

<code_architecture>
The application's architecture is a standard React frontend setup, highly modularized and structured to promote maintainability and adherence to the design system.



**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   ****: This is the cornerstone of the design system. It defines all semantic CSS variables in HSL format for colors (, , , ), gradients (), shadows, and transitions. It was initially fixed due to a  error, ensuring proper color token usage.
-   ****: Integrates the custom CSS variables from  into Tailwind's configuration, allowing the use of semantic classes like , .
-   ****: The main application component, orchestrating the overall structure and potentially managing routing between  and .
-   ****: Implements the Discover Tenders view, incorporating , , and  components.
-   ****: Displays the detailed view of a selected tender, pulling data from .
-   ****: These components (, , , , ) encapsulate specific UI functionalities related to tenders, promoting reusability and modularity.  is crucial for displaying each tender in a consistent and responsive manner, leveraging  for button alignment.
-   ****: Provides realistic, yet mock, data for tenders, allowing the frontend to be fully functional without a backend.
-   ****: This directory contains all Shadcn/ui components (, , etc.) that are customized and used throughout the application, ensuring consistency and accessibility.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully completed the development of the TenderCraft frontend application, a functional prototype for a tender/procurement platform. This includes:
1.  **UI Implementation:** The application faithfully replicates the provided screenshots for the Discover Tenders section (with filters open and closed) and the Tender Details page.
2.  **Design System:** A robust design system has been established, defining semantic HSL color tokens, gradients, shadows, and typography in  and , ensuring visual consistency and easy theming. An initial CSS error related to  was identified through screenshot analysis and corrected.
3.  **Component Structure:** The application is built using a modular component architecture, leveraging Shadcn/ui primitives and custom components for layout, tender display (, ), filtering (), searching (), and an .
4.  **Mock Data:** All frontend interactions and data displays are powered by mock data from , providing a complete functional prototype without a backend.
5.  **Responsiveness:** The application is fully mobile-first responsive, adapting layouts and elements for optimal viewing across various screen sizes, verified through screenshots.
6.  **Quality Assurance:** The application underwent comprehensive automated testing using , passing all checks and confirming its functionality and adherence to design specifications.
7.  **Project Packaging and Git Setup:**
    *   A  archive of the  project () was created for easy download.
    *   Detailed instructions for local setup, dependency installation, running, and building the application were provided.
    *   A Git repository has been initialized within the  directory, and all project files have been added and committed.
    *   A  and  file have been created.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the Git initialization and commit process, and is now awaiting the user's preference for pushing the code to the GitHub repository ().
